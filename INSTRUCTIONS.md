# Project Memory: Hart Stone Ltd System

## 🎯 Project Goal
A professional, premium-tier booking and quoting ecosystem designed specifically for NZ/AU tradesmen. The primary objective is to capture high-quality leads and showcase precision masonry work while maintaining a "high-end" brand image.

## 🛡️ Core Function & Strategy
- **Filter "Tire Kickers":** Use a detailed quote calculator to set price expectations early.
- **Build Trust:** Display compliance with building standards (like NZS 3604) and detailed quality policies.
- **Professionalism:** Replace informal "text-for-a-quote" workflows with a structured system that makes the tradesman look like a top-tier firm.
- **Booking Layout Order:** The Booking page layout must always follow this order: Project Details > Estimation Summary > Calendly Form.
- **Field Requirements:** 'Project Details' must include a 'Special Instructions' field for site-specific details (access codes, pets, etc.).

## 🌏 Regional Rules (AU/NZ)
- **Linguistics:** Use AU/NZ English (e.g., "Labour" not "Labor", "Organise" not "Organize", "Colour" not "Color").
- **Units:** Metric system only (mm, m, m², m³).
- **Dates:** Format as DD/MM/YYYY.
- **Currency:** NZD/AUD (using `$` or `NZD`).
- **Standard Reference:** Focus on NZS 3604 (New Zealand Timber-Framed Buildings) for masonry tie-ins and structural compliance.

## 💻 Developer Note & Preferences

- **Coding Style:**
    - Keep it simple: Avoid deeply nested abstractions or "clever" one-liners that are hard to debug.
    - Favor readability: Use descriptive variable names and clear component structures.
    - Explain "Why": When introducing new React concepts (like `useEffect` or complex state), provide a brief, clear explanation of what is happening.
- **UI/UX:** Maintain the "Brick Red" (#CB4154) and "Oswald" font branding throughout. Ensure every interaction feels "Premium."
